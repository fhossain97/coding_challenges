Steps to solving challenges:

REACTO

1. Restate: simplify the problem and put it in laymen's terms
2. Example: think about the input and the output based on the examples provided
3. Approach: how would you approach solving the problem? consider how to solve it on pen and paper instead of worrying about the nitty gritty
4. Coding: write the actual code based on your approach
5. Testing: test your code
6. Optimizing: if there is time, then think about how to make the logic more efficient. Can you improve the time and space complexity of the problem?
